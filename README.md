## 🛠 About This Application

This program runs inference, which means it processes the audio you give it through pre-trained speech recognition models, then writes out the text it finds. The name "qwen-asr" reflects the use of Qwen3-ASR models, popular for clear speech transcription tasks.

The two models included serve different needs—use the smaller one for quick drafts and the larger one when you want more accuracy.
